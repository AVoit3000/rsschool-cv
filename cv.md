### Information about myself:

A year ago, I thought about changing my line of work and began to explore popular IT professions. I was attracted to web development and decided to settle on the Frontend Developer position.
I enjoy learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and putting my knowledge into practice.
I consider my main qualities as ability to work with large amount of information, desire for knowledge improvement, as well as persistence and diligence.
Thanks to these qualities I have no doubt that I will become an experienced Frontend Developer.
